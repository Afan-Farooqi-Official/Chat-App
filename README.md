Built 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐎𝐧𝐞, a full-stack real-time chat application focused on seamless communication and social interaction.

💬 ChatOne allows users to connect with everyone who logs into the app, send real-time messages and images, view online/offline status, and manage their personal profile — all in a smooth, responsive interface.

• Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
• Backend: Node.js, Express.js
• Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)

✨ 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬
• Real-time messaging and image sharing
• Live online/offline user status
• Secure user authentication

⚠️ 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞: The online/offline status may occasionally blink because the backend is deployed on Vercel, which is a stateless platform and runs only when a request or action is performed.
