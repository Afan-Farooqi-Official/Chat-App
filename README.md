Built **ChatOne**, a full-stack real-time chat application focused on seamless communication and social interaction.

All in a smooth, responsive interface.

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose)  
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.io  
- **Authentication & Security:** JWT, bcryptjs  
- **Media Storage:** Cloudinary, Multer

## ⚠️ Note
The online/offline status may occasionally blink because the backend is deployed on **Vercel**, which is a stateless platform and runs only when a request or action is performed.
